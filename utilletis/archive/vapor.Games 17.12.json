It takes the bulls-eye precision of its predecessor to new and exciting heights, offering more diverse sniper challenges; a rebuilt AI system and the thrilling “one shot, one kill” precision that made the original a huge hit, selling 3 million copies worldwide. Taking advantage of the advanced capabilities of the CryENGINE3, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 also delivers striking graphic environments.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tMotion Sense Trigger System: an innovative first in which the way the player touches the controller influences the on-screen shot. Like in real-world sniping, in-game shooting requires a steady squeeze of the pad’s trigger so that when the round is fired, the rifle is more accurate. Jerk the trigger and the round is thrown off, thus missing the target and alerting a highly motivated enemy to your presence.<br></li><li>\tRealistic Ballistics: the hallmark of the Sniper franchise is the realism of its shooting dynamics.  Wind speed, distance, gravity and bullet-drop all play critical roles in the performance of your shot.<br></li><li>\tRefined Shooting Mechanics: a proper breathing technique to steady your heart rate is as important as calculating the time on target of your round, and the best snipers control both their heart and their head. From acquisition of target until the slow steady trigger pull, a sniper must pull together everything to achieve the ideal “one shot; one kill.”<br></li><li>\tImproved Enemy AI: the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was completely re-tooled and designed from scratch.  Much of the improvements were made possible from the switch to the CryEngine 3. Expect everything from flanking movements to frontal assaults as the enemy tries to engage you in close quarters where your rifle is less effective.<br></li><li>\tNew Target-Rich Environments: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 adds new urban environments like Sarajevo and treacherous mountain terrain to go along with jungles that are as lush and deadly as ever. <br></li><li>\tVarious Difficulty Levels: To diversify gameplay and make it accessible to the widest group of gamers, CI Games is introducing three difficulty levels that totally change the nature of the game. You decide how to play – either relax and be the ultimate predator or test your skill and experience the game on Expert Mode.<br></li><li>\tBullet-Cam: everyone’s favorite feature returns to reward expert shots and show the battlefield from a totally new viewpoint.

In a time of uncertainty, when the city is besieged by plague and ruled by a corrupt government armed with industrial technologies, dark forces conspire to bestow upon you abilities beyond those of any common man – but at what cost?

Rayman Origins brings back many of the classic characters, revived in their original 2D form, as well as a whole new world of characters and environments.  <br></li><li><strong>Four-Player, Jump-In/Jump-Out, Co-op Gameplay:</strong> Play as Rayman in the solo campaign, or have up to three friends jump in at any time to play as Globox or as one of the two Teensies.  Players can leave at any time without affecting the others’ progression.  <br></li><li><strong>Unique Approach to 2D Art:</strong> A rich world with over 100 characters and 12 unique environments created by some of the video gaming’s most reputed artists and animators.  This creative approach to 2D design will recapture the hearts of platformer fans and introduce a new generation to one of the industry’s best-loved characters in his original 2D form.<br></li><li><strong>A Vast Playground:</strong> Rayman Origins includes over 60 levels of 2D platforming gameplay designed for all ages and playing styles.  Unlock new abilities progressively and return to previous levels to discover new paths and secrets.<br></li><li><strong>Variety of Gameplay:</strong> Rayman Origins is a platformer at its core, but it has elements of many game genres.  Rayman, Globox, and the Teensies gain unique abilities as they progress through the adventure, including swimming, diving and the sensational “HairlyCopter.”  The game also features many elements of action, adventure, and beat-’em-up gameplay.<br></li><li><strong>Epic Boss Fights:</strong> A giant pink monster with hundreds of eyes... A possessed, mountainous golem...  An evil daisy-cum-carnivorous plant...Rayman Origins will put players to the test with these and many more challenging boss battles!<br></li><li><strong>A Handful of Highly Talented Artists and Engineers:</strong> Rayman Origins was developed by the UBIart team in Montpellier and is built on an open-source game engine - the UBIart Framework - designed by Michel Ancel to allow much smaller teams of artists and developers to produce incredibly high-quality graphics and gameplay quickly and efficiently.  This garage-game approach has led to great strides in creativity and innovation.</li></ul>",
